# tendermint_refund

The purpose of this script is to create a json file to refund users from a slash event.

## Important Notes:
In order for this to work, you will need access to a node that has history as far back as your slashing event. 
Most public nodes only keep ~100 blocks! We maintain the last 10,000 blocks for every chain we validate on.
If you need an endpoint for a network [we support](https://www.lavenderfive.com/), please reach out! 

Note also that this will only refund the **LATEST** slashing event!!

## Requirements:
1. You will need to install the dependencies. 

```python:
  # using poetry:
  poetry install

  # using pip:
  pip install
```

2. In order to send the commands, the daemon will need to be installed locally. This is not ideal, but was the choice
made early on. Rebuilding with https://github.com/fetchai/cosmpy would be neato.

3. Add your refund mnemonics to the daemon as `--keyring-backend test` that way you won't need to enter a password. Do
**NOT** use your validator wallet for the refunds. Create a different wallet, load up the amount you'll need to refund,
and go from there.

## Usage:
```
git clone https://github.com/LavenderFive/slash_refunds_tendermint.git
cd slash_refunds_tendermint
python3 src/slash_refund.py --denom {denom} --daemon {daemon} --c {chain_id} -e {rpc_endpoint} -vc {valcons_address} -v {valoper_address} -s {send_address}

# example:
python3 src/slash_refund.py --denom uatom --min_refund 100 --daemon gaiad --c cosmoshub-4 -e http://65.21.132.124:10657 -vc cosmosvalcons1c5e86exd7jsyhcfqdejltdsagjfrvv8xv22368 -v cosmosvaloper140l6y2gp3gxvay6qtn70re7z2s0gn57zfd832j -s cosmos15s9vggt9d0xumzqeq89scy4lku4k6qlzvvv2lz -m "With üíú from Lavender.Five Nodes üêù"
```

This will output two different kinds of files

* `/tmp/dist_<batch #>.json` which is the unsigned JSON representation of a batch transaction
* `~/dist_<batch #>_signed.json` which represents the signed, but not yet broadcast batch transaaction

```bash
$ python3 src/slash_refund.py --help
usage: slash_refund.py [-h] --denom DENOM --daemon DAEMON -c CHAIN_ID -e ENDPOINT -vc VALCONS_ADDRESS -v VALOPER_ADDRESS -s SEND_ADDRESS [-m MEMO] -k KEYNAME [--dry_run [DRY_RUN]] [-f REFUND_FILE]

Create json file for refunding slashing to delegators

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --denom DENOM         denom for refunds (ex. uatom)
  --mr MIN_REFUND, --min_refund MIN_REFUND
                        the minimum threshold for slashing compensation (ex. to refund any value more than 0.001 $ATOM, you should set --min_refund 1000)
  --daemon DAEMON       daemon for refunds (ex. gaiad)
  -c CHAIN_ID, --chain_id CHAIN_ID
                        Chain ID (ex. cosmoshub-4)
  -e ENDPOINT, --endpoint ENDPOINT
                        RPC endpoint to node for gathering data
  -vc VALCONS_ADDRESS, --valcons_address VALCONS_ADDRESS
                        Valcons address of validator (ex. cosmosvalcons1c5e86exd7jsyhcfqdejltdsagjfrvv8xv22368),
                        you can get this by doing {daemon} tendermint show-address
  -v VALOPER_ADDRESS, --valoper_address VALOPER_ADDRESS
                        Valoper address of validator (ex. cosmosvaloper140l6y2gp3gxvay6qtn70re7z2s0gn57zfd832j),
                        you can get this by doing {daemon} keys show --bech=val -a {keyname}
  -s SEND_ADDRESS, --send_address SEND_ADDRESS
                        Address to send funds from
  -m MEMO, --memo MEMO  Optional. Memo to send in each tx (ex. With üíú from Lavender.Five Nodes üêù)
  -k KEYNAME, --keyname KEYNAME
                        Wallet to issue refunds from
  -f REFUND_FILE, --refund_file REFUND_FILE
                        CSV file that encodes the delegator addresses and refund amounts. Note: delegator address is expected to be in the first column and the refund amount in [DENOM] is expected to be in the fourth column.
  --dry_run             Indicates whether this should actually broadcast transactions or not
  --no_broadcast        Similar to dry run, but in this case the tx JSON is output and signed, but not broadcast. This is useful for testing.
